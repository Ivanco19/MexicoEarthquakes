# MexicoEarthquakes

This serves as the third project within the Data Analysis Boot Camp at Tec de Monterrey and EdEx. The primary objective of this project is to facilitate a comprehensive visualization of both the quantity and intensity of earthquakes that transpired in Mexico during the year 2023. These data points are depicted through a geographical map of Mexico, a segmented bar graph providing insights at the state level, and a dynamic line graph enabling users to visualize the magnitude of earthquakes throughout the year. Only events with a magnitude of 4.0 or greater were taken into consideration due to the ammount of datapoints and to facilitate the visualization to the user.

## Instructions of use:
To use this project, the user must simply ensure that the CSV is properly linked to the index.html File. To visualize the compleated project, two options are avalable:
 - Generate a pull request of the full code and executa a local host using index.html
 - Follow this link: https://ivanco19.github.io/MexicoEarthquakes/templates/index.html



## Ethical Considerations:
This data is provided by SSN, an organization administered by UNAM and is avalable to all public therfore allowing this project to be built for educational purpouses only. The dataset presented is limited to the year 2023, and as such, caution should be exercised in relying exclusively on these findings for forecasting future earthquake patterns. Nevertheless, this project serves as a valuable tool for viewers to visualize and analyze seismic activity throughout the year 2023, providing a detailed snapshot of the observed patterns within the specified timeframe.

## Refrences for used code:
This project includes code from the following sources.
 - Bootstrap
 - D3
 - Plotly
The majority of the code from these sources is exclusively for the building and formating of the graphs.
