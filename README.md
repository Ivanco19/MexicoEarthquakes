# MexicoEarthquakes

This is project three for Data analysis boot camp on Tec de Monterrey and EdEx. This project is made to help visualize the ammout and intencity of earthquakes in mexico that occured in 2023. these datapoints are represented in a map of mexico, a bargraph that is segmented by states and a linegraph that allows you to vixzualize the magnitude of earthquakes during the year.

## Instructions of use:
To use this project, the user must simply ensure that the CSV is properly linked to the index.html File. To visualize the compleated project, two options are avalable:
 - Generate a pull request of the full code and executa a local host using index.html
 - Follow this link: https://ivanco19.github.io/MexicoEarthquakes/templates/index.html



## Ethical Considerations:
This data is provided by SSN, an organization administered by UNAM and is avalable to all public therfore allowing this project to be built for educational purpouses only. The dataset presented is limited to the year 2023, and as such, caution should be exercised in relying exclusively on these findings for forecasting future earthquake patterns. Nevertheless, this project serves as a valuable tool for viewers to visualize and analyze seismic activity throughout the year 2023, providing a detailed snapshot of the observed patterns within the specified timeframe.
